# Project

This category mainly aggregates various security tools, and prefers complete projects with higher availability.



## ksubdomain
#### Project link：

[https://github.com/knownsec/ksubdomain](https://github.com/knownsec/ksubdomain)

#### Project Overview：

ksubdomain is the fastest subdomain enumeration tool, and it runs on Windows/Linux/Mac.



## Zoomeye Tools
#### Project link：

[https://github.com/knownsec/Zoomeye-Tools](https://github.com/knownsec/Zoomeye-Tools)

#### Project Overview：

Zoomeye Tools includes Zoomeye minitools and Zoomeye preview.

Minitools is currently integrated for use in zoomeye.org, copy all targets in multiple formats, and enter the next scan in a convenient and quick way.

Preview implements a simple Zoomeye interface. When a user login and clicks on preview, he can quickly and easily see various information of the current station ip and open port information.



## Pocsuite3
#### Project link：

#### Project Overview：

[ZoomEye](https://www.zoomeye.org/) is a search engine for cyberspace that lets the user find specific network components(ip, services, etc.).

[ZoomEye API](https://www.zoomeye.org/api/doc) is a web service that provides convenient access to ZoomEye features, data, information over HTTPS. The platform API empowers developers to automate, extend and connected with ZoomEye. You can use the ZoomEye platform API to programmatically create apps, provision some add-ons and perform some automate tasks. Just imagine that what you could do amazing stuff with ZoomEye.



## wam
#### Project link：

[https://github.com/knownsec/wam](https://github.com/knownsec/wam)

#### Project Overview：

WAM is a platform powered by Python to monitor "Web App", "The dynamic network information". To a certain extent, it greatly help the security researchers save time on tracking the vulnerable code updates and industry dynamics of investment.

AM Model: This module can monitor every updates on all of apps on internet, analysising the changes to make Tag and provide mail notification;

IDM Model: This module uses Web crawler to fetch the industry dynamic information and report that to users;

VDR Model: This module manager all of application package in the history, and save the updated version of which DIFF details;




# Minitools

This category mainly aggregates gadgets and scripts involved in various security research processes, aiming to optimize the daily security automation experience.

## ipstatistics
#### Project link：

[https://github.com/knownsec/Minitools-ipstatistics](https://github.com/knownsec/Minitools-ipstatistics)

#### Project Overview：

ipstatistics is a script based on the ipip library that is used to quickly filter the ip list. It can quickly filter out countries, regions, and exclude ip targets in special regions.



## cidrgen
#### Project link：

[https://github.com/knownsec/Minitools-cidrgen](https://github.com/knownsec/Minitools-cidrgen)

#### Project Overview：

cidrgen is based on cidr's subnet IP list generator, which quickly solves the pain points of expanding subnets during scanning.
